# _PrimeSieve_
#### By _**Joshua Lovelace**_

## Description

_PrimeSieve describes a class that takes an integer number at initialization, then uses the get_primes method to return an array of all primes up to that number._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repo.
* To run the CLI version, do 'ruby PrimeSieve_cli.rb' in the cloned repo
* Enter whatever number you want all the primes up to.

## Known Bugs

_None, though type coercion happens in CLI rather than in-class, so if you use the class in some program, you may want to add some type validation._
